  `You know, we've never really hung out before. Maybe we should try it.
Just once.`,

  `Sometimes I wonder if what I'm doing at the moment is really what I'm
"supposed" to do. But then I forget about that thought and keep doing it
anyway.`,

  'What does it take to make an octopus laugh? ...Ten tickles.',

  `"Who would even fathom to do such a thing?" she muttered to herself, unable
to comprehend her boyfriend's utter stupidity. "I mean, glowsticks aren't even
flammable!"`,

  `"Hey, I was really drunk and I uh might've eaten some weed pie," he
responded, attempting to defend himself.`,

  `Don't you ever feel the weight of the universe crushing down on your soul,
forcing you to gasp what little air you can get until you finally suffocate
from loneliness? Yeah, me neither.`,

  `A boy just graduated 5th grade, about to go into middle school, so his dad
decided that he deserved some kind of gift. He asks him, "Son, I think you've
done a great job this year, so I'll give you one gift. What do you want, my
boy?" The boy thought for a bit, and said, "Dad, I want a red toothpick." The
dad was confused by such a silly gift, but decided not to ask any questions and
got him a red toothpick.`,

  `A few years later, the boy is graduating 8th grade now, going into high
school. The dad once again thought that he should give his son a gift, and so he
asks, "Lad, you've been a really great boy these past few years, so I'm going to
give you another gift. What do you want, son?" The child thought for a bit, and
said, "Dad, you know what I really want? An orange toothpick. That is all I
want." The dad, again confused, wanted to ask why, but decided to leave him
alone. He went to the store and bought his son an orange toothpick.`,

  `Another four years pass and the son is graduating high school now. The dad,
very proud of his son, wanted to give him another gift. He says to his son,
"Son, you have made me very proud. I'm going to give you another gift. What do
you want, lad?" The boy tilted his head down in thought, and finally said, "Dad,
all I want for my graduation is two yellow toothpicks. Nothing more." Dad, still
perplexed by his son's query, could not hold in his curiousity any longer. "Son,
why do you keep asking for toothpicks? I have to know." The son smiled at his
dad and said, "It's a secret, dad."`,

  `Once again the son graduated, but this time he graduated college. He found
his dad after the ceremony and his dad greeted him with a great big hug. "Son!
You have a college degree now! I want to give you another gift. What would you 
like, my boy?" The son looked down at his diploma and back up at his dad. "Dad,
all I want right now is three green toothpicks." The dad, once again, asks his
son, "Why, son, do you ask for this gift? I can't figure out why you want these
toothpicks." The son once again smiles at his dad and says, "It's a secret, dad.
I can't tell you."`,

  `The son went on the graduate school, and after two years, received a master's
degree. He came home late one evening to his dad waiting for him. "Son, you have
accomplished another great feat. What do you want as a reward?" The son looks
around and says to his dad, "I want five blue toothpicks. Not four, not six, but
five pointy toothpicks." The dad, old and tired, has stopped questioning his
son's fascination with toothpicks. He says to his son, "Alright, son I'll go get
you five blue toothpicks."`,

  `A full eight years go by and the son finally earned himself a PhD. He rushes
home to tell his dad the news. The dad says to him, "My boy. My dear boy. You
have done what most would not dare do. Please tell me. What do you want from
your dear father." The boy kneels down and begs to his dad, "Dad please. I would
like nothing more than eight indigo toothpicks." The dad sighs again but he came
prepared. He reached into his pocket and produced eight indigo toothpicks for
his child, the doctor.`,

  `Just a few years later, the son made a breakthrough in his field of study.
He received a Nobel Prize for his contribution to society. After returning home,
his father was grinning from ear to ear. "I would ask for nothing more than a
son with good manners, but you have gone above and beyond my imagination. You
know my next question. What would you like from me, my son?" The son, humbled by
his dad's generosity, asks quietly, "Dad, I would like exactly thirteen purple
toothpicks. This would make me the happiest man alive." The dad, now very old,
trusts his son's judgment. "Alright, son. I will go get you what you wish."`,

  `But then, the son fell very ill. He was hospitalized for a week before the
father was able to come visit him. "Son, I am so sorry I could not have been
here earlier. You must tell me, what can I give you to help you feel better?" he
asks. The son, weak from his illness, croaks, "Dad, you have given me all that I
could ever ask for. There is nothing more that I seek." The father's confusion
could be contained no longer. "Son, I cannot bear to keep this in any longer. I
must know why you have been asking for toothpicks your entire life. Please tell
me, son. I need to know." The son turns his head slowly, and whispers, "Okay,
dad, I will tell you. I-" and then he dies.`
