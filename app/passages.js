  `Living in New York City, I pass by hundreds of people on the street.
And at those moments in time our lives intersect, for just a second. But
the thing is that once that moment passes by I may never see them ever
again, and I would never notice. Maybe I've even met them or talked to
them before. But at those moments in time they're just another face in
the crowd.`,
  `A movie I watched said, "A writer is the sum of their experiences."
But I think that is true for everyone. The way we see the world, how
we interact with our surroundings, is influenced by what we've been
through and where we're going.`,
  `I've been a gamer for pretty much all of my life. I grew up watching my
dad play games on the Nintendo 64 and I remember being unable to beat even
the first level of Star Fox 64. My brother and I tried so hard but just
couldn't do it. Meanwhile my dad beat the entire game like three times over
and we were content just watching... because there was nothing else we could
do.`,
  `When we were younger my brother and I played outside a lot. We roleplayed
our own adventure game (which borrowed a lot from Runescape), set up rock
shops, and just had a lot of fun. Now we don't talk very often but I want to
talk to him more. He is my brother after all.`,
  `My dad is my only role model. There's just so much to respect about him:
he jokes around a lot, loves his work, and works really really hard. He also
started all the hobbies that he does after the age of 30 or 40. He has a really
open minded world view and is really kind. I want to make him proud.`,
  `My closer friends know that when I give advice it tends to be very cold and
logical, but that's only because I'm very removed from the situation so I just
evaluate everything without the cloudiness of emotions. I'm horrible at dealing
with my own problems because all those emotions come rushing in and I can't see
straight.`,
  `I can spend time with one other person indefinitely, but hanging out with more
than one person tires me out really quickly.`
